Instructions
 
 
A list of features / functions that you have implemented, vis-a-vis each of the items 1 to 5 listed under coding requirements above.
 
Generation of random game sets or events


All the enemies, (types, power, and position) are generated randomly. The enemies have mild intelligence,
I.e they can attack the player when in immediate proximity.
We also allow the player to have a chance to attack the enemy as well.
Data structures for storing game status

Structs and vectors are used to check the position of the player and barriers.
Each entity like Enemy, Player, Chests, Map Navigation are done through different classes.


Dynamic memory management



File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)

There are different files to store the previous achievements, levels are stored as maps, and  instructions are also saved in files.
Program codes in multiple files

The programme has 3 different directories with data to store the file
Screens - stores the main interface, achievement and instruction file.
Data - stores maps 
Controllers - store the .cpp and .files necessary 

Proper indentation and naming styles

Proper Indentation and naming style has been followed
In-code documentation

In-code documentation has been done




 
 
 
 
Any non-standard C/C++ libraries, if any, that are used in your work, and what features/functions in your game are supported by these libraries.
No non standard libraries are used.
Compilation and execution instructions. Simply put, this serves like a manual to your program.
Your programs including Makefile and source files (.h / .cpp / .c)
 
 
A video (at most 3 minutes long) demonstrating a gameplay and the implemented features of your program.
 
 
Hand in a link to the repo to Moodle.
